Hi, I’m @martacpt, but you can call me Marta! 

I'm from Portugal and I'm passionate about data analysis, data science and mostly all data related topics! 
I have extensive experience in Analysis (Financial/Reporting) and am currently I'm completing the Data Quest Data Science with Python Program, looking to learn more about Data Science and Machine Learning .

I always enjoy talking to new people who are eager to learn and share their passion with me, so feel free to reach out!
